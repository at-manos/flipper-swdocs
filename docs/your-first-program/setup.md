# Setting up your workspace

Now that you have a simple overview of the goal of this tutorial, let's create our own plugin!

## Creating The Directory

1. Navigate to the `applications` folder
2. Create a new folder inside. Let's call it `box_mover`!
3. Now, let's create a new C file named `box_mover.c` inside of `box_mover`

_Your file structure should look like this_:
```
.
└── flipperzero-firmware/
    └── applications_user/
        └── box_mover/
            └── box_mover.c
```
